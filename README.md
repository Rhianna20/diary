I will be using a Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)

Any Ruby project starts by creating a Gemfile, which lists all libraries (dependent programs, or 'gems') of this project. Bundler, which is a dependency management program for Ruby, can do this for us. Use Bundler's init command:
https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/ruby_web_project_setup_list.md

$> bundle init
List the gems in the Gemfile:


Create a database for users(unique identifer) 
Create another database to connect all posted messages to user.
create a login form
create a home page - for..
create a profile page
create a diary form to save mesaages onto database
